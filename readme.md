# Custom signatures for the browser console ðŸ’ƒ

## This is a fun experiment to test out styling in the browser's console.

Each browser renders styles differently and I have written some notes on my findings below:

## Styling Notes ðŸ’…
1. DEFAULT STYLES: Each browser console has default colors & fonts applied to the text (differs in light & dark mode too).
1. LINE-HEIGHT: used to simulate padding in Firefox console. Value of output is half of value declared
1. COLOR: cannot be applied to links on Safari and Chrome
1. LINKS: not clickable in Firefox.
1. PADDING: padding on links in Chrome are rendered double of the value declared.
1. WIDTH: explicit widths cannot be declared. They're ignored :(
