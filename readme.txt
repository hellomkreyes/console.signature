*** CUSTOM HTML SIGNATURE FOR THE BROWSER CONSOLE ***

This is a fun experiment to test out styling in the browser's console.
Each browser renders styles differently and I have written some notes on my findings below:

--- STYLING NOTES ---
LINE-HEIGHT: used to simulate padding in Firefox console. Value of output is half of value declared
COLOR: cannot be applied to links on Safari and Chrome
LINKS: not clickable in Firefox.
PADDING: padding on links in Chrome are rendered double of the value declared.
WIDTH: explicit widths cannot be declared. They're ignored :(
